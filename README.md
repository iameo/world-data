Raw Data Source: [UN DATA](https://data.un.org/)


Processed files were done by me and categorized by year. I extracted by the latest year in the data. 


### MOTIVATION

I needed to collect more data for a machine learning project and I realized how 'raw' the data was after collecting. I took my time to process it(2019 was beneficial to me so I focused on just taht year and helped around with some other years) and figured I'd save someone the stress.
